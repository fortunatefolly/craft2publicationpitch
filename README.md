Among the topics explored, each week's publication will feature a detailed profile on a local university or college professor explaining their research and how that research will affect the city and beyond. Other regular segments will mine data provided by NYC.gov either for hard news or just a laugh, look for and explain the impact of scientific policy, profile a seemingly non-scientific topic through a scientific lens, examine NYC science history, a feature debunking a scientific myth and more. This will give reporters with a range of interests the opportunity to explore stories on a wide base of topics.
